## ðŸŒŸ About Me

Most of my projects are collaborations with my friend **[Racerapple](https://github.com/RacerApple)**, so be sure to check out his profile too!\
Disclaimer: Most of my code is developed for laptops, so if the proportions seem a bit different on your monitor or mobile device, that's probably why.
